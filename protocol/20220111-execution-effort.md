## Abstract

This FLIP builds on the foundations of the [Variable Transaction fees FLIP](20211007-transaction-fees.md) and proposes a model for measuring the execution effort of transactions by choosing certain functions/operations (features), that are called during the execution of a transaction, to have a related execution effort cost. This FLIP explores a choice of features and uses data collected from sample transactions and a linear model fit to determine the cost of each chosen features, so that on average the execution effort of a transaction is proportional to the execution time of the transaction. This FLIP also explores the FLOW cost of a unit of execution effort.

## Objective

In the [Variable Transaction fees FLIP](20211007-transaction-fees.md) the transaction execution fees are defined as the part of the transaction fees that account for the resources (bandwidth, computing power) needed to execute the transactions' script, to verify the transaction execution and to handle the propagation of transaction execution results. The execution fees (<img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/A0hSAHHSW2.svg">) are defined as a execution effort cost function (<img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/sCA7cYTn4j.svg">) of the execution effort (<img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/WlYFrmB6Y8.svg">) of the transaction <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/Uzsd7p4YBJ.svg">.

The aim of this FLIP is to propose a model for measuring the execution effort of transactions that satisfies the following criteria:

- The model must be better then the current model of measuring the execution effort.
- The model must be straightforward to understand and implement.
- The implementation of the model must not significantly degrade the execution time of transactions.
- The model must be deterministic across nodes, i.e. all execution and verification nodes must measure the same execution effort for a transaction.
- There must be a clear improvement path for the model.
- The model must be byzantine compatible, i.e. hard to game / circumvent.

This first iteration of the model will not account for any networking costs and will assume verification costs are the same as execution costs.

Having a model like that, the secondary goal of this FLIP is to look at how each unit on execution effort would be priced.

## Impact

By improving the model for the execution effort of transactions, transactions will be priced more fairly.

As a consequence transactions that do little (e.g. transferring a (non)fungible token) will cost less, while transactions that do a lot and require a lot of resources to execute (minting a large batch of NFTs) will cost more. Attacking the system with heavy transactions in order to overload it will become costlier and thus less viable.

## Current Implementation

As of [v0.23.6 release](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/tree/v0.23.6), execution effort is coarsely approximated, where every cadence statement, loop iteration or function call represents 1 unit of execution effort, out of a maximum of 9999 *the maximum execution effort limit).

If the execution effort exceeds the execution effort limit (also currently referenced to as gas limit or computation limit) the transaction fails. While the state changes of that transaction are discarded, the fees for that transaction are still deducted.

As of [v0.23.6 release](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/tree/v0.23.6) there is also no connection from execution effort to transaction fees. Transaction fees are always a flat fee of `0.00001 FLOW` for all transactions, no matter the execution effort.

## Proposed Design

To improve measuring of the execution effort of transactions, this FLIP proposes to choose certain features (functions/operations) where weights <!-- $w_i$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/4sadlnRWsG.svg"> will be placed. By counting the number of times each weight is hit, and with what intensity, during the execution of a transaction <!-- $m_i$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/J3058PgFuq.svg">, the execution effort of that transaction can be expressed as <!-- $E = \sum{m_i w_i}$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/uaww76uH7S.svg">.

The assumption made here is that the processing cost of a running a single function <!-- $N$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/4FLaqCTwtI.svg"> times scales linearly with <!-- $N$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/4FLaqCTwtI.svg">. This assumption is made only for transactions where the execution effort of the transaction is not above the execution effort limit.

By choosing suitable weights for the most relevant features, we can approximate a linear correlation between transaction execution time (<!-- $t$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/cbdkfkWybi.svg">) and the transaction's execution effort  <!-- $\frac{t}{E} = \texttt{const}$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/M5uS3sI1wA.svg">.

Making the assumption that if one execution node on average runs one function <!-- $x$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/Cj3XAvtJtn.svg"> times slower it will run all functions <!-- $x$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/Cj3XAvtJtn.svg"> times slower, we can still say that the relationship <!-- $\frac{t}{E} = \texttt{const}$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/M5uS3sI1wA.svg"> will  hold on all machines, but the constant will be different on each machine. This also means that we can chose a reference machine (of certain specifications), where the constant will be 1.

The reference machine was chosen to be a machine with the same specs as the mainnet execution nodes. Doing this the execution effort can also be understood as the "estimated transaction execution time".

### Data Collection

Two sets of data were used:

1. A large set of data from two different machines running generated transactions.
   1. `11032022-machine1-1.csv`
   1. `11032022-machine1-2.csv`
   1. `11032022-machine1-3.csv`
   1. `11032022-machine1-4.csv`
   1. `11032022-machine1-5.csv`
   1. `11032022-machine2-1.csv`
   1. `11032022-machine2-2.csv`
   1. `11032022-machine2-3.csv`
   1. `11032022-machine2-4.csv`
2. A small set of data from transactions on testnet.
   1. `11032022-testnet.csv`
   2. `14032022-testnet.csv`

All the data can be found can be found in the [flow repository](https://github.com/onflow/flow) next to this FLIP.

#### Sample Transaction

The generated transaction data was created by running a lot of transactions generated from a small sample of transactions by varying the loop size in the sample transactions. Sample transactions were chosen with the following things in mind:

- Each transaction should be distinct (the code path they go through should be different).
- Transactions should not do a lot of different operations.
- The entire set of transaction should cover as many distinct operations as possible.

Some setup is done before any transactions are run so that more diverse transactions are possible:

- A list od 5 strings of 100 characters is put on the service account `acct.save(list, to: /storage/test)`
- A smart contract is deployed with some functions to be called by the transactions:

  ```cadence
  access(all) contract TestContract {
      pub var totalSupply: UInt64
      pub var nfts: @[NFT]

      access(all) event SomeEvent()
      access(all) fun empty() {
      }
      access(all) fun emit() {
          emit SomeEvent()
      }

      access(all) fun mintNFT() {
          var newNFT <- create NFT(
              id: TestContract.totalSupply,
              data: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
          )
          self.nfts.append( <- newNFT)

          TestContract.totalSupply = TestContract.totalSupply + UInt64(1)
      }

      pub resource NFT {
          pub let id: UInt64
          pub let data: String

          init(
              id: UInt64,
              data: String,
          ) {
              self.id = id
              self.data = data
          }
      }

      init() {
          self.totalSupply = 0
          self.nfts <- []
      }
  }
  ```

All of the sample transactions have the same boilerplate body:

```cadence
import FungibleToken from 0xFUNGIBLETOKEN
import FlowToken from 0xFLOWTOKEN
import TestContract from 0xTESTCONTRACT

transaction(){
    prepare(signer: AuthAccount){
        var i = 0
        while i < $ITERATIONS {
            i = i + 1
            $BODY
        }
    }
}
```

The number of iterations (`$ITERATIONS`) is randomly chosen from one to _max loop length_ which is varied during the run so that the transaction does not exceed 500 ms (generally) (See [Appendix 1: varying sample transactions max loop length](#appendix-1-varying-sample-transactions-max-loop-length) for details). This is done so its easier to compare different types of transaction to each other.

In order to get more varied data, mixed transactions were also simulated. Mixed transactions are created by taking two different sample transactions and running both in one transaction. Each of the sample transaction bodies are run between 1 and _max loop length_/2 times.

#### Sample Transaction Data Collection procedure

The data was collected by simulating block execution. Each block had between 1 and 50 transactions (uniformly distributed).

Transactions were either:

- (2/3 of the time) picked from the set of sample transactions and the loop length was randomly picked from 1 to the `max loop length`.
- (1/3 ot the time) constructed by combining two different sample transactions each having a loop length from 1 to `max loop length/2` (`max loop length` is different for each transaction type).

After block was executed the weight data and the execution time was extracted from the logs for each transaction in that block.

The execution time of each sample transaction is then used to adapt that sample transactions _max loop length_ so that the execution time would stay below 500 ms

A new execution state was created for every 100 blocks, clearing all state changes done by the previous transactions.

The collected data has the following form:

| Transaction type name     | Multiple columns of features                                                                                                                                                          | transaction execution time ("ms")                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### Testnet Data

Testnet data was collected by deploying modified code to one execution node, that logged all the feature intensities per transactions. This was done around March 11th 2022.
### Feature Placement

A total of 21 different features were originally used.
Of those 20 weights were placed in functions in `transactionEnv.go` which implements the interface between Cadence and the flow virtual machine (FVM).

The `function_or_loop_call` weight is an exception as that counts any cadence function (function calls in the cadence script) and any cadence loop. This is also the weight that is already currently in place, as discussed above.

The weights `GetValue` and `SetValue` are also different, as instead of just counting the number of times a transaction calls those functions, they instead count how many bytes were read or written, when they are called.

| Feature name               | Feature intensity <br> (per feature call)              | Intent of the code of the feature                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| function_or_loop_call      | one per cadence invocation, function call or loop call | Called every time a cadence function is called a a loop is made in cadence                                  |
| GetValue                   | Number of bytes read from a register                   | Get the value of a storage register                                                                         |
| SetValue                   | Number of bytes saved to a register                    | Set a value to a storage register                                                                           |

| ContractFunctionInvoke     | 1                                                      | Called when a contract function is invoked by the FVM directly (fee deduction, getting account balance,...) |

### Data Analysis

During data analysis the goals and challenges were:

- Model should be in a linear form.
- Model’s weights should all be positive.
- Linear model is better to not have the intercept constant team (a transaction that does nothing should not have a non-zero execution effort cost).
- The number of features used for the model should be as small as possible.

The full data analysis report can be found in the [flow repository next to this FLIP](./20220111-execution-effort/Flow-execution-effort-prediction-model.docx.pdf). The following are just the results of that data analysis.

Resulting model highlights:
- The proposed champion model achieve the better performance when compared to the current production benchmark model model in terms of goodness of fit.
- Only 4 features in the model.
- All weights are positive.

Resulting model:

`Execution effort = 'function_or_loop_call' * 0.0004789016465827949 + 'GetValue' * 0.0002466779730553598 + 'CreateAccount' * 0.8660748805785956 + 'SetValue' * 0.0002335080887671281`

## Final Execution Effort Feature Weights and Maximum Execution Effort Limit

Changing the maximum execution effort limit (a.k.a. gas limit) for end users which is 9999 would cause a lot of braking changes in SDKs and current user code.
Instead this FLIP proposes to keep the maximum execution effort limit as is, and change the feature weights accordingly, so a desired estimated execution time is reached at 9999 execution effort.

This can be done, since the feature weights from the previous section model the estimated execution time for a transaction, when that transaction is run on a reference execution node.

🚧 The numbers in the following section might change 🚧

The chosen maximum estimated execution time a transaction can take was chosen to be `200 ms`. This was chosen to be high to make the transition to variable execution fees easier, as it is less likely that a transaction that would previously pass would now reach the limit. This limit will be tweaked in the future when more data is available. For reference, there is currently (March 2022) about 1 transaction per hour on mainnet on average that is above the 200ms limit mark.

This gives the following final feature weights that will be set on mainnet:

|                                                                                      | Cadence invocation,<br> function call or loop | GetValue (per byte) | SetValue (per byte) | Create Account |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Feature weight <br> compared to the total maximum <br>execution effort limit of 9999 | 0.023                                         | 0.0123              | 0.0117              | 43.2994        |


Some facts that can be gleamed from this table:
- A transaction that has a simple loop that does nothing (or nothing much), could only be `9999` iterations long before, but can now be `9999/0.023 = 434739` iterations long.
- A transaction could create a maximum of around `9999/43.2994=231` new account accounts.
- Reading data is slightly more expensive than writing data

See table in [Appendix 2](#appendix-2-table-of-changes-for-common-transactions) for a overview of how that affects certain transactions.

Scripts are affected by the same limits.

## Execution Effort Cost

The cost of one unit of execution effort was picked in order to better secure the network against heavy transactions, while making still making light transactions (FT/NFT transfers) cheaper. The transaction costs of even the most heavy transactions will still be very small. The costs will continue to be tweaked in the future in order to better secure the network.

🚧 The numbers in the following section might change 🚧

This FLIP proposes to change the static inclusion fees from `1E-5` FLOW to `1E-6` FLOW and charging the execution effort cost from `0.0` FLOW per effort to `4.99E-08` FLOW per effort.

This will make the most expensive transaction 50 times more expensive then before, but most transactions will become cheaper (up to 10 times), or stay in the same range as before.

See table in [Appendix 2](#appendix-2-table-of-changes-for-common-transactions) for a overview of how that affects certain transactions.
## The Future of the Model

The model parameters will have to change if the execution code changes. Currently all code changes still happen during sporks. This means that before a spork new data collection and fitting will need to be done, to see if the feature weights need to be adjusted.

The proposed model is also the first iteration on the path to pricing transactions fairly. This model needs to be further improved in the future. The following chapters address possible upgrade paths.

### Known Missing Feature

More features could be added to the model by exploring the code further and seeing what could have an impact. Most features were selected on the FVM layer, but having features from the cadence layer in the model might capture something that the current features don't.

### Data Collection

The majority of transaction measurements collected were simulated and might not represent transaction seen "in the wild". To improve the data set, more data could be collected from testnet and mainnet. To do this each transaction (or a sample of them) on mainnet would need to log feature intensities which is something that will be in place in the future.

### Outlier Analysis

The model can be improved by looking at the execution path of outliers, and trying to discern if any features are missing on those execution paths to make the model better.

### Failing Transactions

The model did not cover costs of the FVM recovering after a failure. These should be minimal, but the avenue should be explored in the future.

## Implementation

### Code Changes

The high level view of the code changes needed is:

- Add metering to a lot of functions in the fvm
- The metering function takes a feature identifier and a unsigned intensity
- When metering take note of each intensity. Multiply the intensity by the feature's weight and add it to the total execution effort used. If the total execution effort used is more that the execution effort limit return an error from the meter.
- At the end of the transaction send the total metered execution effort to the fees calculation, but cap it at the transactions gas limit, so we never charge more than the gas limit.
- If a certain condition is met (i.e.: debug logging) also log all feature intensities.

The code should allow mimicking the current way of metering execution effort if the feature weights are not set, or are set to certain values. This should be the default

### Release Plan

After a spork when this code reaches mainnet the fees and the execution effort metering/limiting will still be unchanged.
When the decision is made to apply the execution effort weights described in this FLIP, that will be done with a transaction from the service account.


After this first transaction the transaction execution effort limiting will change, and the `FlowFees.FeesDeducted` event will contain the new execution effort, but the execution effort will not yet influence fees (because the execution effort cost will still be set to 0).
<!-- TODO: put this transaction in flow -core contracts and link it here -->

Another [transaction](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/blob/master/transactions/FlowServiceAccount/set_tx_fee_parameters.cdc) is then needed to update the inclusion effort cost and the execution effort cost.

## Performance Implications

The impact to performance is low. This only adds some addition and multiplication when certain functions are called.

## User Impact

There are two impacts to the users:

1. The transaction fees will change, and will no longer be static. Light transactions will be up to 10 times cheaper and heavy transactions will be up to 50 times more expensive. The most expensive transaction will be `0.0005 FLOW`.

2. The transaction execution limiting will change. Which might cause some transactions that were above the limit to now succeed. It will also cause some transactions that were previously below the limit to now fail. Limits were picked so that this will happen rarely.

## Questions and Discussion Topics

## Appendices

### Appendix 1: Varying sample transactions max loop length

Sample transactions are run with a varying loop length that is randomly chosen between 1 and _max loop length_ for that transaction type. As an example a loop length of 100 means that the create account sample transaction will take about 2000 times longer than the reference sample transaction. This causes two problems:

1. The transaction types are difficult to compare and visualize in a graph because they are in completely different time scales.
2. The time resolution is 1 ms which means that if the whole span from 1 loop to _max loop length_ for a transaction type is under 10 ms there will be a lot of error in the measurement.

To address this problem the _max loop length_ (per sample transaction type) is adjusted during the data collection so that the transaction times generally span from 0 to 500 milliseconds.

This is achieved using the following method. Using the assumption that we are already making, that the time taken to execute a transaction (<!-- $t$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/IaaH0s0S1C.svg">) is proportional to transactions loop length (<!-- $l$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/flUdOiZru7.svg">), we can write the following relation.

<!-- $$
t \approx kl
$$ -->

<div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/4fBxFBaa1u.svg"></div>

Given the desired maximum time of 500 ms (t_max), the maximum loop length (<!-- $l_\textbf{max}$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/nTaimah637.svg">) can be written as

<!-- $$
\frac{t_\textbf{max}}{k} = l_\textbf{max}
$$ -->

<div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/81WicaV3gM.svg"></div>

The coefficient <!-- $k$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/fSFxSlgTsg.svg"> can be expressed with the date from all the previous runs. <!-- $N$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/Cd7RKP5BBD.svg"> is the last run of this transaction type, <!-- $t_i$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/TL162H0uyX.svg"> and <!-- $l_i$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/ksMl1VjIVd.svg"> are the time taken and loop length of the i-th run of this transaction type.

<div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/t8txgKtOmc.svg"></div>

So we don't have to keep track of all previous <!-- $t_i$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/Y54OjO1DWR.svg"> and <!-- $l_i$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/P1NUv79K4S.svg">, we can express <!-- $k_{N+1}$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/k684IPYDW2.svg"> with <!-- $k_{N}$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/Mtl8xqt59u.svg"> in the following manner.

<div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="./20220111-execution-effort/eq/XMTbAMXYFN.svg"></div>

This means that we can update the _max loop length_ after every transaction of this type with this pseudocode

```py
# can be set to 0 starting out
k = 0
N = 0
# some starting max loop length that is not too high
l_max = 100
# the desired maximum transaction execution time
t_max = 500 # ms

def update_max_loop_length(loop_length, time_taken_to_execute):
    k = (N * k + time_taken_to_execute/loop_length)/(N + 1)
    N = N + 1
    l_max = t_max/k
```
