# FLIP 242: Improve Capability Construction in Cap Con API

## Objective

This FLIP proposes some improvements to the way that capabilities are obtained with the new Capability Controllers API when the capability does not exist.

## Motivation

When Cadence 1.0 goes live, Capability Controllers will be the new way to obtain and manage capabilities. With it, comes a change to what happens if a capability doesn't exist.
Whereas before you would get a capability which would fail to borrow (unless it was later linked), now a nil object will be returned. This will present some challenges for existing
applications which use capabilities even if they are not borrowable. This includes:

1. [Royalties](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/blob/master/contracts/MetadataViews.cdc#L303) - The Royalties Metadata standard assumes you can build a capability, there is no standard based on the kind of token you want to send a user. As such, many
platforms which follow the royalties standard take the return capability's address and reconstruct the correct one afterwards.
2. [Lost and Found](https://github.com/Flowtyio/lost-and-found/blob/main/contracts/LostAndFound.cdc#L720) - Helps users distribute resources to accounts. If a provided capability is not valid
(`check` returns false), it will store the resource for a user to redeem at a later date. If Capabilities now return nil when they aren't present, this utility contract will be much more challenging
to use. Lost and Found is used by a few marketplace platforms to ensure that things like Royalties can be distributed even if the receiving account is not configured, it is a safeguard against malicious
behavior as well for other contracts like Flowty Loans.

## User Benefit

There is value in a Capability not being nil, even if it is not borrowable. Nil is not the same as invalid because we still have the address field which is something that is used often by developers.
Modifying the behavior for obtaining capabilities to instead give an invalid capability allows developers to make use of that address and react to something not being valid. It also introduces fewer
panic scenarios that are out of general-purpose platforms' control (like if an NFT Collection panics on Royalty creation because of this). 

## Design Proposal

Returning a capability in the `PublicAccount.capabilities.get(...)` path instead of an optional will alleviate these pain points. This capability need not correct itself if the path that was
requested is later valid.

## Alternatives Considered

It was suggested that anything which is expecting a non-nil Capability could instead request their own struct which would be carried along with the Capability itself

```
struct OptCap {
    let address: Address
    let cap: Capability? 
}
```

This might work in cases where the method being called is entirely in control of the caller, but it will not cover cases like Royalties where they are being blindly resolved using the 
Flow Metadata Standard. In cases like that, the caller has no way to protect itself again an optional capability that will panic when being created
