# FLIP 131: Removal of Custom Destructors

## Objective

This FLIP proposes to remove support for destructors from Cadence. 
In particular, resources will neither be required nor able to declare a special `destroy` method. 
Instead, any nested resources will automatically be destroyed when the resource is destroyed. 

## Motivation

The primary motivation for this is to resolve the "trolling attack" that can be used to 
exploit resources and attachments, whereby a `panic`ing destructor is added to a resource or attachment
without the owner's knowledge, and thus unremovably takes up space in an account. By removing the ability
to declare custom destructors, malicious actors would not be able to prevent the destruction or removal 
of a resource or attachment. 

In addition to trolling, the existence of customizeable destructors also requires developers to be extremely careful
when writing contracts because they can have arbitrary side effects. Developers could, for example, write a destructor for a
`Vault` that "destroys" the `Vault` by moving its funds elsewhere, rather than burning them. This becomes even more dangerous
in the presence of attachments because developers cannot always know a priori what destructors will even run when a given resource is destroyed.

### Background Context

Previous discussions around the attachments/deletion trolling attack have already uncovered a few particular takeaways:

* Not a problem with attachments. Rather, already today, the inability to force delete a resource is a problem – attachments worsen the situation
* The contents of a resource are potentially a bigger problem than the storage usage of the resource
* The ability of a user to delete is more important than the ability of the type author to prevent the deletion
* “Follow-up logic” needs to be separate from destruction, destruction needs to always succeed (e.g. FT total supply)
* Current order of destructors should ideally be kept
* Either side (user and author) could troll, e.g. author could prevent destruction, but user could also prevent destructor logic to fail

As such, solution proposals that either only address the storage cost aspect of the problem,
only address the attachments-specific portion of the problem,
or otherwise do not ensure that a user is always able to delete any resource they own, are not sufficient for addressing this issue. 

We have proposed other solutions to this in the past, including:

* Try-Catch, where a destructor would be required to catch any potential panics and handle them in a way that guarantees successful deletion 
of the resource.
* Banning panicking operations in a destructor entirely
* Successfully cleaning up a resource when its destructor panics before aborting execution
* Separating destruction into a two-phase process that separates clean-up from actually deleting the resource

The issue with all of these is either that they significantly complicate the language, are technically very challenging to implement, or both. 

## User Benefit

The primary benefit of this change would be the ability to enable the attachments feature without any
security concerns. 

However, a secondary benefit is that the language would change to reflect the practical realities of Cadence on-chain more closely. 
Although the language guarantees that the `destroy` method of a resource is invoked whenever that resource is destroyed with the `destroy`
statement, the reality is more complicated. There are ways to take a resource (e.g. an NFT or a token) "out of circulation" without actually
destroying it; an easy example would be sending that resource to a locked account where it is irretrievable. Such resources are destroyed in
the sense that they cannot be interacted with further, and as such any logic that relies on destructors to guarantee an accurate count of how many 
of a resource exist (e.g. `totalSupply` in the Fungible Token contract), to prevent the destruction of resources that do not satisfy certain conditions, 
or to emit an event when a resource is destroyed, is in practice impossible. 
As such, removing support for custom destructors would prevent developers being mislead about the possible guarantees that can be made about their resources. 

## Design Proposal

The design is simple; `destroy` will no longer be a declarable special function. Instead, 
when a resource is destroyed, any nested resources in that resource will be recursively destroyed as well. Effectively,
the behavior will be the same as if the author of the `destroy` method had simply done the minimal implementation of that method, 
destroying sub-resources and nothing else. 

So, e.g. a resource `R` defined like this:

```cadence

resource SubResource {
    //...
}

resource R {
    let subResource: @Sub
    let subArray: @[Sub]

    // ...
}
```

would automatically destroy the `subResource` and `subArray` fields when it itself is destroyed. Users would not be able to 
rely on any specific order for the execution of these destructors, but because nothing can happen in destructors except for destruction 
of sub-resource, it would not be possible for the order to matter. The order is deterministic (in the way that iterating over an atree dictionary 
is deterministic), but will not be specified by the language.

### Destruction Events

In order to continue to support the critical use case of off-chain tracking of destroyed resources, 
support will be added for defining a default event to be automatically emitted whenever a resource is destroyed.

Resource (and resource interface) types will support the definition of a `ResourceDestroyed` event in the body of the resource definition, 
to be automatically emitted whenever that resource is `destroy`ed. In the case of a resource interface, the `ResourceDestroyed` event 
would be emitted whenever any resources conforming to that interface are destroyed; this behavior is equivalent to how a `destroy` defined
in an interface would work today, if an event were emitted in its pre or post conditions. So, for example:

```cadence
resource interface I {
    event ResourceDestroyed()
}

resource interface J {
    event ResourceDestroyed()
}

resource R: I, J {
    event ResourceDestroyed()
}
```

if a value of type `@R` is destroyed, three events would be emitted: `I.ResourceDestroyed`, `J.ResourceDestroyed` and `R.ResourceDestroyed`. 

`ResourceDestroyed` events will not be `emit`able normally; any `emit` statement attempting to `emit` one will fail statically. 
This is to ensure that these events are only emitted on resource destruction. 

Like other events, `ResourceDestroyed` can have fields. 
However, as this event is emitted automatically rather than manually, the syntax for declaring specifying the values associated with these fields is different.
A `ResourceDestroyed` event declaration has support for default arguments provided to its parameters, like so:

```cadence
resource R {
    let foo: String

    event ResourceDestroyed(x: Int = 3, y: String = self.foo)

    // rest of the resource
}
```

In this example, the `R.ResourceDestroyed` event has two fields, `x` and `y`, whose values are specified by the given arguments. 
In this case `x`'s value is `3`, while `y`'s value is whatever `self.foo` contains at the time that `R` is destroyed. 

The possible arguments are restricted to expressions that cannot possibly abort during evaluation. The following expression are allowed:
* Constant expressions whose type is numerical (e.g. `Int`, `UFix64` or `Word16`), `String`, `Bool`, `Address`,  or `nil` 
* field accesses (e.g. `self.foo`, `base.nestedResource.bar`, or `foo?.field`) whose type is one of the aforementioned permitted types
    * the accessed expression must also necessarily obey these restrictions
* indexed access expressions on dictionaries (e.g. `dict[0]`) whose type is one of the aforementioned permitted types
    * both the indexed and the indexing expression must also necessarily obey these restrictions
* attachment access expressions on composites (e.g. `self[A]`) whose type is one of the aforementioned permitted types
    * the indexed expression must also necessarily obey these restrictions
    * note that because attachment expressions always return an optional reference to the attachment type, they will only ever be permitted in this context
      when a field is accesssed on the resulting attachment type like so: `self[A]?.field`

In particular, some expressions that are not allowed because they may abort are:
* Arithmetic operations (they may overflow or underflow)
* Array accesses (they may abort if the index is out of bounds)
* Function calls (they may abort)
* Dereference or force expressions, which may fail if the reference or optional is `nil`

These arguments are also evaluated lazily when the resource is destroyed; i.e. any field accesses will use the values
in those fields at time of resource destruction, rather than resource creation. 

### Drawbacks

This will break a large amount of existing code, and further increase the Stable Cadence migration burden. 

### Compatibility

This will not be backwards compatible. Developers will need to restructure their contracts accordingly. 
Destructors that were previously used to guarantee event emission can be rewritten with default events, but 
cases that actually used `panic` or performed state tracking in destructors will need to be restructured. 

### Alternatives Considered

There has been some other discussion of potential alternatives to this in the past for solving the "trolling attack". 
The attack relies on a user defining an aborting destructor to make it impossible to destroy an attachment, and as such potential solutions
have been proposed to specifically ban panicking or aborting operations in destructors, or to have some kind of try-catch mechanism to continue
destruction after an abort. 

The issue with both of these solutions is their technical complexity; we estimate that either would take between 6 months to a year to design and
implement, and as they are both breaking changes, we would need to delay the release of Stable Cadence until the feature was complete. The hope
with this proposal is that the simpler change would both solve the problem and allow a faster release of Stable Cadence, with all its attendant benefits.

### User Impact

To evaluate the impact of this change, existing contracts on Mainnet were surveyed. 
A [custom linter](https://github.com/onflow/cadence-tools/pull/194) was defined to identify contracts containing complex destructors,
where a complex destructor is defined as one that performs and logic beyond recursively destroying sub-resources.

1711 total complex destructors exist currently on Mainnet.

Of these, 6 distinct categories of operations were identified (note that some destructors may fall into more than 1 category):

* Event emission: this destructor emits an event to signal that the resource was destroyed. 1328 of the complex destructors are of this kind
* Total Supply Decrementing: this destructor decrements a `totalSupply` variable. 492 of the complex destructors are of this kind
* Conditions/Assertions: this destructor asserts a condition, either with a pre/post condition or an assert statement. 29 of the complex destructors are of this kind
* Logging: this destructor logs some data. 17 of the complex destructors are of this kind
* Panic: this destructor panics under some circumstances. 10 of the complex destructors are of this kind
* Other complex operations: this destructor performs some logic that is not included in these categories (e.g. function call, resource movement). 211 of the complex destructors are of this kind. 

Based on this data, we can see that the two largest use cases for complex destructors currently is emitting an event signalling destruction, and decrementing the total supply for a token of some kind. 
While developers cannot actually rely on this logic to actually execute (events will not be emitted nor supply decremented when a resource is sent to a burner account), these use cases would be most
negatively impacted by this change. 

The Condition/Assertion and Panic categories are uncommon, and also anti-patterns. 
Destructors being able to abort execution is the source of the attachments-related "trolling" attack in the first place, 
and any solution we come up with for this would necessarily involve circumventing these operations.

## Prior Art

Move is an example of a resource-based smart contract language that does not allow the definition of custom destructors. 

## Questions and Discussion Topics

* Because this proposes to remove support for `destroy` entirely, it would be possible to re-add support back later once
we can make the method safer with respect to the trolling problem (e.g. by adding support for try-catch).
