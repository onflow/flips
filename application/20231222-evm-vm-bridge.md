## Objective

This proposal outlines a contract-based protocol enabling the automated bridging of arbitrary Fungible (FT) and
Non-Fungible tokens (NFT) from Cadence into FlowEVM into the corresponding ERC-20 and ERC-721 token types. In the
opposite direction, it supports bridging of arbitrary FlowEVM ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens into the corresponding
Cadence FT or NFT token types.

To facilitate users bridging tokens between VMs, the protocol internalizes capabilities to deploy new token contracts in
either VM state as needed. It serves as a request router & corresponding contract registrar to guarantee the
synchronization integrity of assets being bridged across VM states. It additionally automates account and contract calls
to enforce source VM asset burn or lock and target VM token mint or unlock. `CadenceOwnedAccounts` (COAs) introduced
in the [EVM support FLIP proposal](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/225) enable the Flow VM Bridge to operate across
both state spaces within the same, atomic transaction resulting in instantaneous asset exchange. 

## Motivation

The success and viability of EVM on Flow depends on the ability for assets to move unimpeded between VM states. The Flow
VM bridge resolves the need for token portability at the platform level. Its design is consistent with cross-chain
bridging protocols common in Web 3 in order to ensure onchain transparency. A generalized solution which addresses
scalability and security concerns arising from arbitrary token bridging can better ensure the security of users on the
platform.

## User Benefit

An efficient, easy to use bridge which modifies state across VMs simultaneously in a single transaction reduces
complexity for builders and improves end-user experience for the essential economic activity of moving tokens across
VMs. The abstraction afforded to users by the bridge means that multiple EVM transaction steps can be bundled together
using Cadence to securely realize bridging as a single transaction. The availability of a secure and proven platform
capability for cross-VM bridging can ensure a consistent, higher security bar than leaving developers to implement
project specific token bridges. It also significantly reduces the effort required of developers wishing to build
applications which need to bridge tokens between VMs for an optimal user experience.

## Bridge Specification

Specification outline of the Flow VM bridge for bi-directional flow of FT and NFTs between VM states. While the spec
references NFTs, the VM bridge will treat both FTs and NFTs alike, with the caveat that NFTs have more complexity due to
their more detailed metadata which needs to be made to work for both VMs. With that said, many FTs on Flow define useful
onchain contract-level metadata, so we may also choose to bridge select metadata for FTs as well.

### Cadence to EVM

Breakdown of the steps required to bridge a token across VMs from Cadence to EVM. 

#### VM bridge contract functionality

* Configure EVM-defining contract if needed
* Maintain Flow <-> EVM contract relationships
* Provide utility methods for information lookup about contracts for either state space

#### Prerequisites to user actions

1. Confirm counterparty contract deployed state, else deploy
2. Setup and configure NFT metadata
3. Safety/integrity checks as needed

#### Cadence transaction: bridge a Cadence NFT to CadenceOwnedAccount

1. Ensure prerequisites
2. Store NFT into VM bridge Cadence contract escrow
3. EVM transaction: mint corresponding NFT in EVM contract or transfer if the NFT already exists

### EVM to Cadence

Sequential breakdown of the flow for a user bridging a token from EVM to Flow. The high level paths below are broken
down into their respective forks to help with understanding.

#### VM bridge contract functionality

* Initialize Cadence NFT contract
* Maintain Flow <-> EVM contract relationships
* Provide utility methods for information lookup about contracts for either state space

**Path 1: Cadence originated NFT returning to Cadence**

#### Cadence transaction: COA A bridges an EVM NFT back to Cadence

* COA A calls bridge to request bridging of EVM NFT back into Cadence
* Bridge contract calls into EVM to confirm COA A is the owner of the requested NFT. If so, process continues; otherwise
  reverts
* Bridge executes the protected `safeTransfer` call provided by COA A, transferring the ERC721 token to the bridge
  for escrow
* Bridge contract unlocks corresponding Cadence NFT from VM bridge contract escrow storage
* Returns NFT on call to bridge contract

#### Cadence transaction: COA B bought COA A's EVM NFT on FlowEVM, and then wants to bridge it back to Cadence

* COA B calls bridge contract to request bridging of EVM NFT back into Cadence
* Bridge contract calls into EVM to confirm COA B is the owner of the requested NFT. If so, process continues; otherwise
  reverts
* Bridge executes the protected `safeTransfer` call provided by COA A, transferring the ERC721 token to the bridge
  for escrow
* Contract unlocks corresponding Cadence NFT from VM bridge contract escrow storage
* Returns NFT on call to bridge contract

**Path 2: EVM originated NFT bridging to Cadence**

#### Prerequisite steps to user actions

* Defining corresponding Cadence contract must been deployed to the bridge. This is done via bridge contract templates where the deployed contract is "owned" by the bridge and actions on it orchestrated by contract logic.

#### Cadence transaction: COA A wants to bridge an EVM NFT to Cadence

* Ensure prerequisites 
* Within the Cadence call to bridge, a protected `safeTransfer` call is included, transferring the ERC721 from the caller to the bridge escrow
* Bridge checks that the named owner is the owner of the NFT on EVM side before executing approval to Bridge account COA address
* Bridge ensures transfer was successful
* Bridge validates its ownership of the NFT on EVM side after transfer, thus locking NFT to be bridged
* Bridge unlocks the Cadence NFT if escrowed, otherwise mints NFT from the bridge-owned NFT contract and returns to caller
* Collection is configured if necessary and deposited to COA A's account

# Design Proposal

## Context

It's helpful to understand that the entrypoint to FlowEVM is mediated by the [`CadenceOwnedAccount`
(COA)](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/225). This Cadence resource provides access to FlowEVM, enabling encoded
calls into EVM originating from the calling COA's EVM address. In short, it's a resource that also functions as an EVM
account whose access is controlled by resource ownership instead of an offchain signature.

COAs are the only cross-VM objects universally available from Cadence. This type provides the means to use Solidity's
identity-based approach for access and enables any address to receive assets; callers bridging *to* FlowEVM from Cadence
may transfer tokens to any EVM address. In the opposite direction, only COAs may initiate bridging *from* EVM since
there is not yet a mechanism to initiate Cadence state change from the EVM environment.

Hopefully, this context clarifies that bridging in either direction - Cadence -> EVM & EVM -> Cadence - is at all times
initiated via call to the bridge's Cadence contracts.

It's also interesting to note that any project could build an asset-specific bridge between VMs using the same
primitives and toolsets leveraged for the design below. However, the intention for this bridge is to provide public
infrastructure to seamlessly and permissionlessly move assets between VMs without requiring the support of the asset
developers while maintaining a high security bar for all users of the bridge.

## Overview

Given the variety of problem components and drivers of complexity - namely storage and the potential spam vector -
initial designs targeted a distributed approach. Based on feedback alleviating concerns around storage and the
complexity introduced by said distribution, this iteration aggregates all bridge-related contracts & resources in a
single account.

Updates to this implementation also include deeper integration with the CadenceOwnedAccount resource (COA), enabling
asset bridging via a simple interface available directly from a COA.

The central bridge contract will act as a secondary (to the COA interface) entry point for bridge requests,
orchestrating asset onboarding deployments & configuration, and minting/burning + lock/unlock as needed to fulfill
requests. Deployed contracts are “owned” by the bridge, but owner interactions are mediated by contract logic on either
end in addition to multi-sig patterns consistent with other core network infrastructure accounts.

On the EVM side, a central contract factory will instantiate ERC20 & ERC721 contracts as directed by calls from the
bridge’s COA. This factory will also implement a number of helper methods to give the bridge contracts visibility into the
EVM environment. These methods might include things like retrieving an asset’s interface conformance, determining if EVM
contracts are bridge-owned, validating asset ownership, etc. so the COA has a central trusted source of truth for
critical state assertions.

> :information_source: An important conceptual point worth noting is that bridge requests are only initiated via
> Cadence. Since EVM cannot initiate state change in the Cadence environment, bridging in either direction is always
> performed via calls on Cadence resources and contracts.

## Bridge Onboarding

Given some asset in either Cadence or EVM, there is necessarily some source contract that defines it. The environment in
which that source contract resides is the environment to which the asset is considered “native”.

In order for the bridge to fulfill a given request, it’s necessary for a defining contract to exist in the target VM, a
known association between source and target contracts to exist, and for the bridge to have some mechanism for either
escrow or minting/burning.

Due to how contract deployments function with relationship to state availability, this deployment and configuration must
be completed in a distinct transaction prior to fulfilling bridge requests. **The bridge cannot fulfill a request in the same
transaction in which it also deploys the target contract as the deployed contract will not exist in the state space
until after the transaction is complete.**

This configuration process will be termed “onboarding”, and an asset for which the bridge is configured to handle will
be considered “onboarded”. This action, unless a project has explicitly disabled bridging, can be executed by anyone as
its protected by contract logic. In virtually all cases, the bridge will deploy and own a contract in the non-native
environment enabling it to perform privileged functions such as minting and updating metadata, again protected by bridge
contract logic.

There is a small minority of assets that do not conform to the standard configuration and require special handling based
on business or protocol requirements. What follows addresses call flows for the vast majority of NFT bridge requests.
See [Special Cases](#special-cases) below for more information and context on such assets.

## In Aggregate

Diagrams depicting the call flows for both Flow- and EVM-native NFTs bridging according to the proposed design are
included later in this FLIP. Beside those pictured, auxiliary contracts will exist to support bridge operations such as
interfaces, utilities, configuration, etc., but the are not pictured below as they are not critical to high-level
bridging operations. Immediately below is a birds-eye view of the contract suite across VMs.

![FlowEVM VM Bridge Design Overview](20231222-evm-vm-bridge-resources/overview.png)
*Bridge functionality is enabled directly on the COA resource for simplicity, with call passing through the EVM contract
to a routing resource to the central VM bridge. The central bridge contract then handles bridging requests dependent on
whether the asset is an NFT or FT, whether the asset is Cadence- or EVM-native, and the direction of the request. Due to
the need to special case some assets, Handlers are built in to the bridge enabling custom passthroughs based on
non-standard business logic. For most all assets, at asset onboarding, the bridge performs contract initialization on
either side of the VM by dynamically deploying EVM or Cadence contracts and maintaining associations between source and
target contract definitions. Post-onboarding, the bridge routes requests to the appropriate contract to fulfills
caller’s request. While bridging is integrated to the COA resource, the central bridge contract’s entry points are
publicly accessible.*

## Implementation Details

### Contract Roles & Concerns

#### Flow

- **EVM Contract Integration (EVM & EVMBridgeRouter)**
  - Enable COA to bridge FT/NFTs between VMs
  - Route requests from COAs to VM bridge

- **Bridge**
  - Unified entry point for bridging assets between VMs
  - Unified query point for NFT escrow contracts & to assess Cadence x EVM contract associations
  - Owning (via contract COA) all deployed contracts on EVM side
  - Escrowing (via contract COA) all assets on EVM side when bridged to Flow
  - Initializing BridgedFT & BridgedNFT contracts defining EVM-native assets when first bridged to Cadence
- **FT/NFT Escrow**
  - Lock tokens bridging to EVM
  - Unlock tokens bridging from EVM
  - Serve query requests about locked tokens - e.g. resolving token metadata
- **Bridged FT/NFT**
  - Define EVM-native tokens bridged from EVM to Flow
  - Point to the corresponding EVM-native contract
  - Maintain up-to-date token metadata with source ERC20/721 as ground truth

#### EVM

> :information_source: Note: Self-defined locking functionality is not required as “locked” assets will simply be
> transferred to the FlowEVMBridge.COA.EVMAddress

- **FlowBridgeFactory**
  - Deploys new instances of FlowBridgedFT/NFT
  - Maintains knowledge of all deployed contract addresses & their Flow token identifier correspondence
  - Aids visibility of bridge contract into the EVM environment with assistive methods

- **FlowBridgedFT/NFT**
  - Define Cadence-native tokens bridged from Cadence to EVM
  - Point to the corresponding Cadence-native contract
  - Contain bridged token metadata updated at time of last bridging

### Case Studies

The task of bridging FTs & NFTs between VMs can be split into four distinct cases, each with their own unique path. An
asset can either be Cadence- or EVM-native, and it can either be bridged from Cadence to EVM or EVM to Cadence. The following
sections outline an NFT bridge path for each case.

> :information_source: A note about bridge "onboarding" - assets moving from one VM to another must at minimum have
> contracts defining them in their target VM. These contracts must be deployed in a transaction preceding the movement
> of the asset as deployed contracts are not available in the Cadence's state space until the deploying transaction has
> finalized. Thus, onboarding cannot be done on the fly and must be a discrete step of the bridging process.

#### Cadence-Native NFT Onboarding

1. Pre-flight checks: Assert the type is supported, hasn't opted out, requires onboarding, and fee provider can provide onboarding fee
2. Withdraw onboard fee from given fee Provider & deposit to bridge Vault
3. Does the bridge have a custom Handler for this type?
    a. If so, revert as a Handler implies custom configuration.
    b. Otherwise, continue
4. Is this an NFT or FT? - NFT, continue as NFT
5. Deploy ERC721 from factory, passing on identifying information from the type & its defining Cadence contract
    a. Factory retains deployed address & Cadence type identifier in mapping & reverse mapping
    b. Returns the deployed ERC721 address
6. Call to BridgeNFTEscrow to initialize escrow locker, passing on the type and deployed ERC721 address
7. Associate the type with the deployed ERC721 address

#### Cadence-Native: Cadence -> EVM

*Lock in Cadence & Mint/Transfer in EVM*

1. Pre-flight checks: Assert the type is supported, has been onboarded, and fee provider can provide onboarding fee
2. Get a URI for the NFT

    - If not defined, serialize the NFT as JSON data URL
3. Lock NFT in escrow
4. Calculate the bridge fee based on flat fee + storage usage
5. Withdraw onboard fee from given fee Provider & deposit to bridge Vault
6. Get the token's corresponding ERC721 contract address
5. Execute the bridge
    - Check if the ERC721 is factory-deployed - Cadence-native: return true
        - If the token exists, transfer and update the URI
        - Otherwise mint the token to the recipient with the URI
    - Otherwise transfer the token to the recipient

3. Get the requested type's associated EVM contract address
4. Assert the caller is the requested ERC721 token owner or approved
5. Execute the provided protected callback
6. Assert that now the bridge COA is the ERC721 token owner after executing the protected callback
7. Derive the requested type's contract address & name & attempt to borrow the contract as EVMBridgeMinter
8. Get the tokenURI from the ERC721 contract

asset itself, while implemented according to common standards, plays a non-standard role in either ecosystem. One such
asset falling into this category is `FlowToken`, though there may be others in the future. Here, we’ll discuss how these
two cases are handled by the bridge.

#### FlowToken

**Context**

Since $FLOW is the native token in both VMs, moving $FLOW between Cadence and EVM is integrated directly into the COA
resource and can be done without dependency on the VM bridge.

Bridging the token between VMs can be done easily via the EVM Cadence contract interface and its constructs. Soon (if
not already at time of reading) $FLOW will be integrated directly into the `EVMAddress` object and can be deposited
directly to any address in EVM without the need to involve a COA resource at all. Bridging $FLOW from EVM can be done
via any COA, resulting in a vault that can be handled like any other Cadence Vault resource.

**Bridge Configuration**

Given the protocol-native integration of \$FLOW, the bridge will then special case on receipt of a request to bridge
$FLOW to/from either VM and revert. This can be done simply by filtering on the `Type` of the requested asset. To the
need for callers to filter bridge transactions on the `Type` of the requested asset, the bridge will simply leverage the
existing mechanisms to handle $FLOW bridging.

On observing a request to bridge $FLOW to EVM, the bridge will simply leverage the existing `EVMAddress` interface to
deposit the provided Vault to the named recipient. However, since bridging $FLOW from EVM is built into the COA resource
and must be called from the owning COA - a call which is fundamentally different than that required to transfer ERC20 to
escrow - the same passthrough functionality cannot be leveraged. Due to these factors, requests to bridge $FLOW from EVM
will be filtered and reverted.

#### Generalized Cases

> :information_source: **TL;DR:** Requests to bridge special cased assets in either direction will be filtered,
> identified, and passed through to a custom handler. This handler will be initialized to disable bridging until
> explicitly enabled, at which point an association between the defining Cadence & EVM contracts will be simultaneously

> needed to fulfill requests via the typical bridge entrypoints.

Building in special-cased functionality will aid code extensibility as the resources handling these requests can define
logic as needed on a case-by-case basis while maintaining a unified entry point for all bridge requests. As a
generalized solution for handling special cases, the bridge will leverage a `Handler` resource interface and maintain a
mapping of Cadence Types to Handler resource implementations.

<details>
<summary>Handler interface</summary>

```cadence
// Entitlement related to admin-like functionality
access(all) entitlement Admin

access(all) resource interface Handler {
	// Flag determining if request handling is enabled
	access(self) var enabled: Bool
	// The Cadence Type this handler fulfills requests for
	access(self) var targetType: Type?
	// The EVM contract address this handler fulfills requests for
	access(self) var targetEVMAddress: EVM.EVMAddress?

	// Getters
	//
	access(all)	view fun isEnabled(): Bool
	access(all) view fun targetType(): Type?
	access(all) view fun targetEVMAddress: EVM.EVMAddress?

	// Handling
	//
	access(EVM.Bridge) fun fulfillTokensToEVM(
		tokens: @{FungibleToken.Vault},
		to: EVM.EVMAddress
	) {
		pre {
			self.isEnabled(): "Handler is not yet enabled"
			tokens.getType() == self.targetType(): "Invalid Vault type"
		}
	}
	access(EVM.Bridge) fun fulfillTokensFromEVM(
		owner: EVM.EVMAddress
		type: Type,
		amount: UFix64,
		protectedTransferCall: fun (): EVM.Result
	): @{FungibleTokens.Vault} {
		pre {
			self.isEnabled(): "Handler is not yet enabled"
		}
		post {
			tokens.getType() == self.targetType(): "Invalid Vault type returned"
		}
	}
	
	// Admin access
	//
	access(Admin) fun setTargetType(_ type: Type) {
		pre {
			self.targetType != nil: "Target Type has already been set"
		}
	}
	access(Admin) fun setTargetEVMAddress(_ address: EVM.EVMAddress) {
		pre {
			self.targetEVMAddress != nil: "Target EVM address has already been set"
		}
	}
	access(Admin) fun enableBridging() {
		pre {
			self.targetType != nil && self.targetEVMAddress != nil:
				"Cannot enable before setting bridge targets"
			!self.isEnabled(): "Handler already enabled"
		}
		post {
			self.enabled: "Problem enabling Handler"
		}
	}
}
```
</details>

Any use-case specific `Handler` will then be added to the bridge's `handlers` mapping indexed on the relevant asset
Cadence Type. In the event a Cadence type does not exist, the related EVM contract address can be added to a `filter`
value, preventing onboarding of the EVM asset before a Cadence defining Type and Handler can be configured in the
bridge.

Once the `Handler` is enabled and the type -> EVM contract address association is established, the bridge will route
requests associated with the special-cased type through the `Handler` for fulfillment.

As you might imagine, this approach requires coordination from between bridge maintainers and special-cased asset
developers and it is unlikely that many assets will require such treatment; however, it will be helpful to have the
option to support non-standard bridge configurations available from the beginning.

### Considerations

#### NFT Metadata

##### Problem

Platform expectations between EVM & Flow NFT metadata storage differ. Whereas Flow projects generally prioritize onchain
metadata (with the exception of image data), EVM projects typically store NFT metadata in offchain systems - typically
in json blobs found in IPFS, though other patterns are also commonly used.

Since the bridge is public infrastructure, there is a need to generalize the breadth of migrated metadata. Minimizing
metadata would mean:

- Looking solely at the Solidity contract, bridged Flow-native NFTs would have very little identifying information per
  the ERC721 standard - ID & perhaps an image pointer.
- Looking solely at the Cadence contract, bridged EVM-native NFTs would have very little available onchain metadata - ID
  & perhaps an IPFS URI.

For typical bridge infrastructure connecting separate zones of sovereignty, metadata migration could be handled by their
offchain system components. However, the requirement for atomic asset migration between VMs prevents the inclusion of
such offchain systems as they would break atomicity and introduce the need for undesirable trust assumptions. For
example, upon bridging an NFT from Flow to EVM, an offchain listener would need to recognize a request to post metadata
to IPFS, post the metadata, and commit that URI to the defining EVM contract for the relevant NFT. We must trust that a/
the request is served, b/ metadata committed to IPFS, c/ commitment to the EVM contract succeeds and d/ that URI is
correct and contains correct metadata. Then there is the issue of IPFS storage funding.

##### Potential Solutions
___
ℹ️ **Update:** Since the original writing of this FLIP, another solution was proposed and implemented (currently in review
[here](https://github.com/onflow/flow-evm-bridge/pull/20)). While ideating in conversation with
[@austinkline](https://github.com/austinkline), he pointed out that data URLs are a common method for formatting and
inscribing ERC721 token URIs and mentioned he had an initial implementation of serialization in Cadence. This format
opened the door for on-the-fly serialization during the bridging flow, enabling the bridge to take a given NFT and
serialize it according to JSON schemas most commonly recognized in EVM and commit the serialized value as a data URL for
the token's URI.

Since serialization and URI data is all onchain, this URI can be updated as the Cadence NFT's metadata
changes as is the case for NFTs with sub-NFTs for instance. The format targeted for this initial implementation happens
to be OpenSea's metadata standards ([reference docs](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards)). A Mainnet
compatible script can be run here against any account and NFT for easy use and feedback.

Also note that a metadata view serving URI values is leveraged and defaulted to in the event projects wish to define
their bridged asset's metadata themselves. This view is currently defined as `CrossVMNFT.EVMBridgedMetadata`, but is
also presented for considered inclusion as a standard view in `MetadataViews` in [this
PR](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/pull/203)
___

Alternatively, if Flow projects want their metadata to be served well across VMs, they may take it on themselves to add
offchain IPFS metadata. This would allow the ecosystem to both maintain onchain metadata advantages as well as reach
parity with EVM platform expectations. We may then want to consider a Cadence metadata view specifically for IPFS-stored
metadata to support this use case.

Yet another alternative, it may be possible to expose an API matching that of IPFS gateways so that bridge-stored NFTs
metadata could be served to IPFS clients as they would request URI material from any other provider. Imagine some IPFS
HTTP gateway say `https://ipfs.flow.com/ipfs/CID` where CID is some content-based addressing of the NFT. Requests to the
gateway could be served by access/observer or other data-availability node which, upon receiving a request, would derive
the information about where to locate the NFT from the CID, query for the NFT metadata and serialize it into a JSON blob
conforming to ERC721 metadata standards before returning the blob. On bridging a Flow-native NFT to Flow EVM, the IPFS
URI would be derived and committed to the minted NFT in the EVM side.

This construction would mean that NFT metadata never has to leave the Cadence runtime environment, but can be served on
request as if it was being retrieved from any other IPFS gateway. Of course, the engineering effort is then displaced to
Cadence serialization APIs, the mechanism to construct a CID from the provided NFT content, and an IPFS-like API bolted
on to some DA client-serving node.

Lastly, and likely more appropriately, there is also the option of creating an API similar to OpenSea's metadata API,
which would allow for querying of bridged NFT metadata from a centralized source. This service could in theory be run by
anyone - Flow Foundation or otherwise. While an offchain API would be a centralized solution, it would enable a
secondary source of truth platforms could leverage to serve metadata to their users and is in keeping with expectations
in the EVM ecosystem.

This problem and potential solutions are presented as a point of discussion and are not necessarily in scope for the
bridge's contract design. In the meantime, generalized scripts will be made available so that metadata can be retrieved
from locked NFTs using information solely available on ERC721 contracts defining bridged Flow-native NFTs (see
[@onflow/flow-evm-bridge#7](https://github.com/onflow/flow-evm-bridge/issues/7)).

#### NFT IDs
___
ℹ️ **Update:** While the id values on Cadence NFTs remains, the path forward on this problem was to introduce a simple
NFT interface (`CrossVMNFT.EVMNFT`) containing all ERC721 relevant values including name, symbol, EVM ID, token URI and
defining EVM contract address. Thanks again to [@austinkline](https://github.com/austinkline) for raising this idea in a
[GitHub comment](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/pull/126/files#r1463811764).
___

NFT ID values are some of the most critical token metadata, identifying each token as unique. While Flow NFTs define
IDs as `UInt64`, ERC721 IDs are `uint256`. It remains an open question as to how this reduction from `UInt256` to
`UInt64` would affect the uniqueness of NFTs bridged from EVM to Flow and how the bridge should handle such conversions
while safeguarding ownership guarantees upon bridging back.

### Drawbacks

- All contracts deployed by the bridge have the same minimized functionality restricted to their respective ecosystem
  standards
- Centralized storage of all bridged assets and their definitions presents a single, high-value target for potential
  hacks.
  - This vector is minimized by the fact that the bridge exists solely at the protocol and contract levels. Taking
    protocol security for granted, contract logic and key management are the primary considerations for compromise. This
    bridge benefits from the contained state space afforded by virtualizing the EVM environment in that offchain systems
    are not required for its function between VMs.

### Considered Alternatives

Motivated by the aforementioned drawback of centralized storage, previous iterations involved a network of distributed
accounts around a primary bridge account and contract. This primary contract served as the entrypoint for bridging
between VMs, deploying templated locking & asset-defining auxiliary contracts to distinct, contract-generated accounts.
The primary contract would conditionally deploy these auxiliary contracts on a per-asset basis as needed, maintaining a
registry for where each asset is locked/defined and routing bridge requests to their appropriate contracts.

The current approach was largely adapted from this design, but with auxiliary (locking & defining) contracts deployed to
the central bridge contract. Due to Cadence's contract namespace, it was also decided to dynamically name these
contracts using contract names derived from the relevant asset type. 

This design optimized for distributed asset storage and contract-mediated access. However, it also introduced additional
complexity and secondarily obscurity for what should be a highly transparent system. Additionally, since multisig access
is planned for the bridge and auxiliary accounts, centralization is ultimately no further improved by this design, at
least while custody is maintained on these accounts.

### Performance Implications

#### Migrations & Storage Usage

Previous network migrations have been complicated by single accounts using large amounts of storage. With a centralized
storage design, it's likely that (over time) the bridge account will consume a large amount of storage and that, given
the need to store bridged Flow-native assets indefinitely, that storage will likely only ever increase. Even if this
assumption is not true, it's to our benefit to consider and plan as if it is if account storage usage is a network-wide
issue.

Informed by initial conversations, saving state to a single account shouldn't be problematic until storage usage reaches
\>10GB of data which should give the team some time to figure out how to handle this edge case during migrations before
the problem is
encountered.

### Examples

At the current design stage, no working examples exist. However, examples will be a fast-follow as work on a proof of
concept continues. With that said, below are example transactions demonstrating the bridging of an NFT to and then from
EVM using the interface defined above.

### Compatibility

This bridge design will support bridging fungible and non-fungible token assets between VMs, and doesn't account for
cases where the type instances overlap - i.e. semi-fungible tokens or multi-token contracts.

Of course, this bridge also dovetails with the ongoing virtualized EVM work, so is dependent on the existence of that
environment.

## Prior Art

While the work is happening concurrently, there may be some cross-pollination between this project and the [Axelar
Interchain Token Service](https://github.com/AnChainAI/anchain-axelar-dapper-flowbridge).

## Questions & Discussion Topics

- What does the interplay between risk vectors, tokenomics, and UX requirements imply for the fee amounts charged for
  bridging between VMs
  - Do we charge on a per instance or per locked storage unit basis?
- How will we handle either bridging or serving metadata for bridged Flow-native NFTs given the difference in metadata
  standards between Cadence & EVM?
- Is there an upper bound to how many contracts a single account can host?
- What if any issues with the NFT ID type differences - `UInt64` in Cadence & `uint256` in Solidity - present for
  potential overflow & collisions when moving between EVM -> Flow?
- Are there additional metadata mechanisms we should consider in the contract designs that would help platforms better
  represent bridged assets?
