# Application FLIPs

Application FLIPs are standards for applications built on top of Flow.
This could be token standards, contract interface standards, common design patterns that can benefit from social consensus etc.
Application standards should not create protocol changes in themselves,
and if they rely on any new protocol features that feature should be written up in its own protocol FLIP.
