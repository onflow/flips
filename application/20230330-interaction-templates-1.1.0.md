## Abstract

This FLIP proposes a new standard for how contract developers, wallets, users, auditors and applications, can create, audit and verify the intent, security and metadata of Flow scripts and transactions, with the goal to improve the understandability and security of authorizing transactions and promote patterns for change resilient composability of applications on Flow.

## Background

### Contract Interactions

A common practice in the development of Flow contracts is to, along with the contracts themselves, also provide a prescribed suite of ways to interact with the contract(s) to accomplish various functionality. Developers who build software that interacts with these contracts can use these interactions in their projects.

For example, alongside Flow's core staking contracts, [a suite of transactions and scripts are provided](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/tree/master/transactions/stakingCollection) for developers who wish to interact with Flow's staking ecosystem. Apps like [Flow Port](https://port.onflow.org), block explorers, wallets, among others use these transactions and scripts to perform staking actions, and query state about Flow's staking ecosystem.

This FLIP proposes that a higher order term for transactions and scripts be called _interactions_. Interaction intends to be a catch-all-term for something that "interacts" with the Flow blockchain to accomplish a goal. This term will be used throughout the remainder of the FLIP.

### Cadence Interpretation

Cadence has made incredible progress in furthering safe, secure, clear and approachable smart contract development on Flow.

However, end users, developers and wallets alike can sometimes have difficulty interpreting what a cadence transaction or script might do when executed. For example, if an end user is presented with a malicious transaction to sign using their wallet, they likely will not have the technical ability to read the cadence transaction to determine that it is malicious.

Wallet developers who wish to safeguard their users from malicious transactions can attempt to inference what a transaction might do before prompting it to be signed by a user. The problem with this approach is that predicting all the outcomes of a transaction is difficult, and an implementation today of such a prediction mechanic for all transactions would likely not be robust enough to provide sufficient user protection.

A pattern that has emerged in the Flow community is for contract developers to have their transactions added to various repositories of known safe transactions. The maintainers of these repositories can audit these transactions for safety, and add them to repository if they are determined to be secure. An example of this in practice is the [Portto (Blocto) Flow-Transactions repository](https://github.com/portto/flow-transactions/blob/main/transactions) . When Blocto is asked to sign a transaction, it checks to see if the transaction exists in their Flow-Transactions repository. If it does, it then has greater confidence in that transactions safety, and makes that confidence known to their user though their UI.

### Interaction Metadata

A cadence script or transaction alone does not contain metadata about itself. Often, application and wallet developers may display a _human readable_ title or description about a transaction before requesting it to be signed by a user. They may wish to display a title and description about each parameter it needs to collect from the user, or information about how the transaction will impact the user's account and assets. The metadata a developer might consume in their application could take many forms and be used for many purposes.

An application or wallet may also want to know what a transaction will _do_ to protect against performing actions that will produce an undesirable result. For example, an application / wallet may wish to prevent a user from executing a transaction that sends more FLOW tokens from their account than they have, because that transaction will fail. An application / wallet may also want to know what version of an interaction's dependency tree it was created against, since because contracts on Flow are mutable, an interaction may change in functionality if its dependencies change.

Currently, applications and wallets are left to come up with their own metadata around the transactions they support. For example, on Flow Port, for each transaction it supports, it has included a title and description for it, along with titles and descriptions of each parameter. Contract developers do not yet have a standardized way to provide metadata around their interactions that can be consumable by the applications and wallets that engage with them.

## Objective

At a high level, Interaction Templates attempt to standardize how contract developers, wallets, users, auditors and applications, can create, audit and verify the intent, security and metadata of Flow scripts and transactions.

### Metadata Standardization

By standardizing **Interaction Template Metadata**, the Flow community can start to build applications that can consume metadata, instead of having to come up with it themselves for each interaction they need to support. Since the format of the metadata would be consistent, this enables parties to support a much wider number of interactions, including any number of arbitrary interactions.

Standardizing metadata helps all parties involved in the execution of an interaction to better understand what the interaction requires and does. For applications, metadata allows them to understand and present the interaction to a user in an intuitive way. For wallets, metadata also helps them understand what a transaction will do to an account, and gives them paths to prevent undesirable outcomes and reject malicious transactions. For users, metadata helps to promote human readable understanding of the impacts of a transaction.

### Interaction Audits

Interaction metadata must be correct in order to be valuable. Metadata that deceives about its underlying interaction can have unfortunate effects for an end user. To prevent against this, standardizing **Interaction Template Audits** can help all parties that consume and produce Interaction Templates to verify and prove that the template is correct.

Creating a mechanic that allows trusted entities to act as auditors, to produce a proof that vouches for the correctness and safety of a Interaction Template; and a mechanic for verifiers (applications, wallets, etc) to prove an audit was created by an auditor they trust, will improve the overall safety and security of the use of Interaction Templates on Flow.

## Design Proposal

### Interaction Interfaces

Many interactions aim to achieve the same class of action according to how that action must be performed with a certain project. Classes of interactions may be things like: "Transfer", "Mint", "Bid", "List", "Destroy" etc.

For example, different marketplaces may have different mechanics behind how a user may "List" their asset on them, but across all implementations, the action "List" is what they all aim to do.

Interaction Interfaces aim to standardize these actions by defining classes of actions, and a set of parameters that Interactions that implement these actions must consume.

Here is an example of an `InteractionTemplateInterface` for "Fungible Token Transfer":

```javascript
{
    f_type: "InteractionTemplateInterface",
    f_version: "1.1.0",
    id: "asadf23234...fas234234", // Unique ID for the data structure.
    data: {
        flip: "FLIP-XXXX",
        title: "Fungible Token Transfer",
        parameters: [
            {
              key: "amount",
              index: 0,
              type: "UFix64"
            },
            {
              key: "to",
              index: 1,
              type: "Address"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### `f_type & f_version`

These fields declare the data structure type and data structure version. The version instructs consumers of this data structure how to operate on it. It also allows the data structure to change in future versions.

#### `id`

This is a unique, content derived identifier for this interaction interface. Each ID is unique for each interaction interface. The portion of information within the `data` field of this data structure is used to create the data structures identifier.

Generating the identifier is done using the process outlined in the [Data Structure Serialization & Identifier Generation](##Data-Structure-Serialization-&-Identifier-Generation) section of this document.

#### `data.flip`

The FLIP number that this interface was established.

#### `data.title`

The title of the interface as specified in the FLIP where it was established.

#### `data.parameter`

The parameters that an interaction that implements this interface must consume. It specifies the name, index and type of each parameter.

In this example, the `InteractionTemplateInterface` defines an interface for Interactions that wish implement it. It defines the parameters the implementing Interaction must have. It also references the FLIP where the `InteractionTemplateInterface` is defined. Interfaces should be defined through the FLIP process, since community consensus should be achieved as the interaction will be used by many parties.

Applications can support executing Interactions that conform to such Interfaces. For example, an application or wallet that displays a users resources may want to display transfer buttons beside each resource a user owns. When the user presses the transfer button, the application can execute the specific Transfer Interaction corresponding to that resources project. Since each of the Transfer Interactions for each project could conform to the same Interface, the application can reuse logic between each, and know how to supply information to each due to the standardized parameters they consume.

### Interaction Templates

Interaction Templates are both metadata and the Cadence for a transaction or script. Interaction templates include:

- Human readable, internationalized messages about the interaction
- The Cadence code to carry out the interaction
- Information about parameters such as internationalized human readable messages and what the parameters act upon.
- Information about the output of a script, if applicable.
- The Interface the Interaction conforms to, if applicable.
- Contract dependencies the Interaction engages with, pinned to a version of their dependency tree.

Interaction Templates at their core are just data. The format of the data for this example is JSON, however it could be possible that in the future Interaction Templates could be represented in other formats.

Here is an example `InteractionTemplate` for a "Transfer FLOW" transaction:

```javascript
{
  f_type: "InteractionTemplate", // Data Type
  f_version: "1.1.0", // Data Type Version
  id: "a2b2d73def...aabc5472d2", // Unique ID for the data structure.
  data: {
    type: "transaction", // "transaction" || "script"
    interface: "asadf23234...fas234234", // ID of InteractionTemplateInterface this conforms to.
    messages: [
      {
        key: "title",
        i18n: [ // Internationalised (BCP-47) set of human readable messages about the interaction
          {

            translation: "Transfer FLOW"
          },

#### `f_type & f_version`

These fields declare the data structure type and data structure version. The version instructs consumers of this data structure how to operate on it. It also allows the data structure to change in future versions.

#### `id`

This is a unique, content derived identifier for this interaction interface. Each ID is unique for each interaction template. The portion of information within the `data` field of this data structure is used to create the data structures identifier.

Generating the identifier is done using the process outlined in the [Data Structure Serialization & Identifier Generation](##Data-Structure-Serialization-&-Identifier-Generation) section of this document.

#### `data`

The content of the interaction template.

All sub-fields of `data` are to be considered optional. A consumer of an Interaction Template should only chose to use those which supply a sufficient amount of information.

#### `data.type`

Either `transaction` or `script` , defining what type of interaction this corresponds to.

#### `data.interface`

The identifier of the interface this interaction template implements. Not all interaction templates should implement an interface, so this is field optional.

#### `data.messages`

Internationalized, human readable messages explaining the interaction. For each message, there can be any number of translations provided. Translations should use [BCP 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) language tags. Messages may also consume parameters, which correspond to the parameters supplied to the transaction.

#### `data.cadence`

The cadence code the interaction executes along with hash values of the fully qualified cadence. If the cadence has imports, the imports are resolved. Example `import "FungibleToken` becomes `import FungibleToken from 0x7e60df042a9c0868` for mainnet and `import FungibleToken from 0x9a0766d93b6608b7` for testnet. 

Full example below would sha256 hash to `4ca967e0c3849d2a1d9a80dab7adf6a9c8b51b35a183a201fd69f1eadcd600fb`
```cadence
import FungibleToken from 0x7e60df042a9c0868
import FlowToken from 0x9a0766d93b6608b7

pub fun main(address: Address): UFix64 {
    let vaultRef = getAccount(address)
        .getCapability(/public/flowTokenBalance)
        .borrow<&FlowToken.Vault{FungibleToken.Balance}>()
        ?? panic("Could not borrow Balance reference to the Vault")

    return vaultRef.balance
}
```


#### `data.dependencies`

For each dependency of the interaction (each contract that is imported in the cadence of the interaction), there must be network keyed (mainnet || testnet) dependency information. The information for each network should contain the address of the account where the contract is deployed, the fully qualified identifier for the contract, dependency tree pin and block height the pin was preformed at. The dependency tree pin is performed by the following pseudocode:

```javascript
// Example contracts map
//
// const contracts = {
//     contract1: {
//        Body: '...',
//        Imports: [contract2], // Imports are in declarative order, as specified in the transaction/script/contract
//        Pin: '', // Pin is initially empty, and will be processed below
//        SelfPin: '' // SelfPin is initially empty, and will be processed below
//    },
//    contract2: {
//        Body: '...',
//        Imports: [...],
//        Pin: '',
//        SelfPin: '' 
//    },
//    // ... more contracts ...
// };

function generateDependentPinDepthFirst(contractKey, contracts) {
    const contract = contracts[contractKey];

    if (contract.Pin !== '') {
        return contract.Pin;
    }

    contract.SelfPin = shaHex(contract.Body);

    const pins = [contract.SelfPin];
    for (const imp of contract.Imports) {
        const dep = generateDependentPinDepthFirst(imp.ContractKey(), contracts);
        pins.push(dep);
    }

    contract.Pin = shaHex(pins.join(''));

    contracts[contractKey] = contract;

    return contract.Pin; // Returned to assist with the recursive algorithm
}

let contracts = generateContractsObjectForEachContractInCadenceCode(cadence) // Generates the example contracts object illustrated above given a cadence transaction or script.

// Compute pins for each contract
for (const contractKey in contracts) {
    generateDependentPinDepthFirst(contractKey, contracts);
}
```

#### `data.parameters`

Internationalized, human readable messages explaining each of the cadence parameters. For each message, there can be any number of translations provided. Translations should use [BCP 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) language tags.

Parameter may correspond to a balance of a fungible or identifier of a non-fungible token. In this case, the balance or identifier the parameter corresponds to should point to its dependency identifier.

#### `data.output`

Like data.parameters, human readable messages explaining the result of  a script. Output property is needed for clarification for consumers and for code generators. This will provide better integration.

#### Arbitrary Execution Phase

A powerful feature of Cadence is the ability for transactions to have well defined `pre` and `post` conditions. These conditions must be true for the transaction these conditions are included in to not be reverted. An Interaction Template for a transaction could include a Cadence transaction without an execution block, along with sufficiently defined pre and post conditions. Consumers of this Interaction Template (applications / wallets) could use such a template while carrying out a transaction with their own filled in execution phases. If the pre and post conditions are sufficiently defined, the execution phase of the transaction could be arbitrary, and the Interaction Template for it be valid.

Example "Transfer Token" transaction cadence code with an unfilled in execution phase:

```text
import "FungibleToken"
transaction(amount: UFix64, to: Address) {
    let vault: @FungibleToken.Vault
    let receiverBalanceBefore: UFix64
    let senderBalanceBefore: UFix64
    let from: Address
    prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
        self.receiverBalanceBefore = getAccount(to).balance
        self.senderBalanceBefore = signer.balance
        self.from = signer.address

        self.vault <- signer
        .borrow<&{FungibleToken.Provider}>(from: /storage/flowTokenVault)!
        .withdraw(amount: amount)

        self.vault <- FungibleToken.getVault(signer)
    }
    pre {
        self.vault.balance == amount
    }
    post {
        getAccount(to).balance == self.receiverBalanceBefore + amount
        getAccount(from).balance = self.senderBalanceBefore - amount
    }
}
```

For more on transaction phases, see [here](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/transactions).

#### Interaction Template Discovery

Contract developers should make available their Interaction Templates to others who wish to use them. They can do this through providing them using a webserver, and have consumers query them. They may also choose to store them on-chain. They may even choose to store them on IPFS. Since Interaction Templates are just data, they could be serialized and stored on any platform.

Contract developers may also choose to store their Interaction Templates behind static identifiers. This allows for the implementation of a Interaction Template to change, while the identifier stays the same. For example, a contract developer may choose to host a webserver and serve an Interaction Template behind a static url:

```
GET interactions.nft-project.com/purchase-nft -> InteractionTemplate
```

Consumers of this Interaction Template could query the static identifier, and always get the most up to date Interaction Template stored there.

Repositories of Interaction Templates could be created to store Interaction Templates from various projects. Developers of Interaction Temaplates could choose to submit their Interaction Templates to such repositories.

Systems for Interaction Template discovery could proxy requests for an Interaction Template to the repository it's known to exist in. Since Interaction Templates are just data, they could be cached and distributed amongst such repositories as desired.

### Interaction Template Audits

An Interaction Template Audit represents a trusted entity vouching for the correctness and safety of an Interaction Template.

Any entity can act as an Auditor and produce Interaction Template Audits.

Consumers such as wallets or applications can query for Interaction Template Audits produced by entities they choose to trust. If found that an auditor has audited a given Interaction Template, the consumer can then have greater confidence in it's correctness and security.

Auditors will first add an Interaction Template Audit Manager resource to their account. The resource will maintain a map of `Interaction Template ID -> isAudited`. This map should be queryable, so a consumer can check if a given auditor with an Interaction Template Audit Manager resource has audited a given Interaction Template.

An auditor should be able to add and revoke audits from their Interaction Template Audit Manager resource.

The Interaction Template Audit Manager should emit events when an audit is added by a given auditor, and when an audit is revoked by a given auditor.

### Proposed Workflow

The following diagram illustrates how a Contract Developer, Auditor, Application and Wallet might work together, in conjunction with an Interaction Template and Interaction Template Audit to carry out a "Purchase NFT" transaction.

In this example, the Contract Developer makes available their Interaction Template in a queryable way for both the Application and Wallet, and the Auditor adds their audit to their Interaction Template Audit Manager resource on the account they control.

![ixtemplate-enitity-diagram5-nodiscovery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14852344/184948691-29240855-37d4-4200-8fe0-2bf692041184.png)

Alternatively, there could exist an Interaction Template discovery service, which could cache and make available the Interaction Template data strcutures produced by Contract Developers. The discovery service could aggregate and cache Interaction Templates stored accross various repositories. In this system, the Application and Wallet can query from the discovery service, instead of needing to be able to potentially query from multiple sources.

![ixtemplate-enitity-diagram4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14852344/184948670-9c33ee5e-9a0f-4779-b3d2-1cb2401aee14.png)

Wallets may choose to trust the same auditor, which makes each audit produced by such an auditor usable by as many entities that choose to trust it. This presents a more scalable pattern than exists prior to this FLIP, where each wallet needed to independently audit each transaction should they choose to do so.

![ixtemplates-sharedauditor2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14852344/184949891-cfc746ef-8335-4f96-ba7b-df0932d6b492.png)

Should a wallet trust multiple auditors, they can query from each for audits produced for a given Interaction Template. Since auditors may not have each audited the same Interaction Template, trusting multiple auditors can allow wallets to have greater audit coverage over possible Interaction Template they may receive.

![IxTemplates-Multiauditor3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14852344/184950498-cb290905-1fbb-4f3b-918a-7df211a26c54.png)

## Dependencies

Interaction Templates depend on contract developers producing and making available Interaction Templates for their contracts. Interaction Template Interfaces depend on the Flow developer community coming to consensus on interfaces for interactions they implement. Interaction Template Audits depend on trusted entities producing and making available audits of Interaction Templates.

### Template, Interface and Audit Tooling

To make the production of Interaction Template, Interaction Template Interface and Interaction Template Audits simpler for developers, support for generating these could be added to a CLI tool or webapp interface. Making these data structures easy to create will be essential for promoting this new pattern.

### FCL Integration

FCL `mutate` and `query` could be modified to accept an Interaction Template, and use the Interaction Template to execute the underlying transaction or script:

EXAMPLE:

```javascript
import transferFLOWTemplate from "./transfer-flow-template.json"

await fcl.mutate({
  template: transferFLOWTemplate,
  args: (arg, t) => [arg("1.0", t.UFix64), arg("0xABC123DEF456", t.Address)],
})
```

EXAMPLE:

```javascript
import { getFLOWBalanceTemplate } from "@onflow/flow-templates"

await fcl.query({
  template: getFLOWBalanceTemplate,
  args: (arg, t) => [arg("0xABC123DEF456", t.Address)],
})
```

Instead, if templates are made available at an external location, developers may chose to request them when needed by querying for them from their location:

EXAMPLE:

```javascript
await fcl.mutate({
  template: "https://transfer-flow.interactions.onflow.org",
  args: (arg, t) => [arg("1.0", t.UFix64), arg("0xABC123DEF456", t.Address)],
})
```

EXAMPLE:

```javascript
await fcl.query({
  template:
    "ipfs://64EC88CA00B268E5BA1A35678A1B5316D212F4F366B2477232534A8AECA37F3C",
  args: (arg, t) => [arg("0xABC123DEF456", t.Address)],
})
```

Since a URL can remain static, while the Interaction Template it corresponds to dynamic and able to change, this allows developers to always request the most up to date implementation of an interaction - enabling a mechanic for contract developers to modify their contracts and interactions while helping to prevent any downstream breaking changes. [flixkit-go](https://github.com/onflow/flixkit-go) has support for creating JavaScript files using Interaction templates. Flow-cli integrates flowkit-go.

### Golang Integrations

Go is a popular language in the Flow ecosystem. [flixkit-go](https://github.com/onflow/flixkit-go) has support for executing, generating and creating JavaScript binding files. Flow-cli integrates flixkit-go so that users can `execute`, `generate` and `package` (create JavaScript that calls the interactive template's cadence.) 

### Wallet Integration

Wallets who chose to support Interaction Templates will need to modify their authorization service to query for Interaction Templates that match the cadence recieved in the signable voucher. Wallets will then need to query from the auditors they trust for Interaction Template Audits for this template, and use those audits to gain confidence in the security and correctness of the Interaction Template.

## Prior Art

- [Portto (Blocto) Flow-Transactions repository](https://github.com/portto/flow-transactions/blob/main/transactions)
- [Flow Staking Ecosystem transactions and scripts](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/tree/master/transactions/stakingCollection)

## Questions and Discussion Topics

- Do viable alternatives to this proposal exist?
- Could the emergence of use of common Cadence contract & resource interfaces across projects reduce the ecosystems dependency on this solution?

## Data Structure Serialization & Identifier Generation

A deterministic serialization algorithm is required to be applied prior to hashing its result to produce identifiers for the `InteractionTemplate` and `InteractionTemplateInterface` data structures.

By serializing each data structure into a specific format, then [RLP encoding](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/) that format, then hashing that encoding, we can generate identifiers for each data structure.

### `InteractionTemplate` f_version 1.1.0
