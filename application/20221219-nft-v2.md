# Non-Fungible Token Standard V2

## Objective

This FLIP proposes multiple updates to the Flow Non-Fungible Token Standard contracts,
primarily about encapsulating functionality within token resources instead of
with the contracts. There are other smaller quality of life changes to the token standard,
such as integration of metadata, improving error handling,
and including a transfer method and interface.
Some of these changes are dependent on other Cadence FLIPs being approved,
primarily [interface inheritance](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/40),
removal of nested type requirements,
and [allowing interfaces to emit events](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/2069).

Most of the changes proposed here would be breaking for all non-fungible token implementations
on the Flow blockchain, but should not be for third-party integrations such as
event listeners and apps that interface with the contracts.

## Motivation

The current non-fungible token standard for Flow
was designed in mid 2019, at a time when Cadence itself was still being designed.
The current standard, though functional, leaves much to be desired.

The current token standard uses contract interfaces.
They are designed in a way which requires each concrete contract
to provide exactly one `NFT` type and one `Collection` type.
This means that any project that needs multiple tokens must deploy multiple contracts.
In the case of very simple tokens, this is a lot of complexity for very little value.

Related to this problem, functionality and metadata associated with some tokens,
such as paths, events, and empty collection creation methods,
is only accessible directly through the contract itself, when it should also
be accessible directly through an instance of a token resource and/or interface.

In the case of events, currently there is no way for the standard to ensure that
implementations are emitting standardized and correct events, which this upgrade will address.

Additionally, the usage of nested type requirements creates some confusing
interactions, which are not useful and make learning about
and interacting with token smart contracts more difficult.

## User Benefit

With these upgrades, users will now be able to:
* Define multiple tokens in a single contract
* Query all the data about a token directly through the token resource and core interfaces
* Have standard events emitted correctly for important operations

## Design Proposal

[The original proposal](https://forum.onflow.org/t/streamlined-token-standards-proposal/3075/1)
is on the Flow Forum.
A [pull request with the suggested code changes](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/pull/126) 
is in the flow fungible token github repository.

The main code changes and their implications are described here.
The linked proposals provide more context.

### Move Event Definitions and emissions to resource interfaces

Instead of requiring events to be defined in the token implementations contracts,
they will only be defined in the non-fungible token standard smart contract and will
be emitted in post-conditions from the correct methods
in the resource interfaces defined in the standard.

This feature is still being designed, so there is not a code sample yet.
See https://github.com/onflow/cadence/issues/2069 for potential examples

### Add Type and Metadata parameters to events

Standard events contain more information about the NFT that is being transferred,
such as the type of the NFT and important metadata about the NFT.

Here is a simple example of what this could look like:

```cadence
pub event Deposit(id: UInt64, to: Address?, type: Type, displayView: MetadataViews.Display?, serialView: MetadataViews.Serial?)
```
Or a more involved example: (from [find](https://f.dnz.dev/4fd2a0ccdc3a6cdb2774872b4ac5b32c167e60ae5850ba2b34ef4a749433fe4e)):

### Include Transferable Interface with transfer method

For managing simple transfers, tokens can now implement the transferable interface
and the transfer method.

```cadence
    pub resource interface Transferable {
        /// Function for a direct transfer instead of having to do a deposit and withdrawal
        /// Returns Bool to indicate if the transfer succeeded or not
        pub fun transfer(id: UInt64, receiver: Capability<&AnyResource{Receiver}>): Bool
    }
```

### Add `getAcceptedTypes()` method to `Receiver` interface

It is useful to be able to query a non-fungible token receiver to see what types of tokens
it can accept.

```cadence
    pub resource interface Receiver {

        /// deposit takes an NFT as an argument and adds it to the Collection
        ///
        pub fun deposit(token: @AnyResource{NFT})

        /// getAcceptedTypes returns a list of NFT types that this receiver accepts
        pub fun getAcceptedTypes(): {Type: Bool}
    }
```

### Change the return type of `borrowNFT()` to an optional

In the current standard, `borrowNFT()` is meant to panic if the NFT to borrow
is not found in the collection. This is clearly the wrong choice, because 
it is a best practice to have getter functions return `nil` if something goes wrong
instead of panicing and reverting the transaction.

```cadence
pub fun borrowNFT(id: UInt64): &AnyResource{NFT}?
```

### Remove the requirement for the `ownedNFTs` field in `Collection`

The requirement to include an `ownedNFTs: {UInt64: @NFT}` field
in Collection implementations is restrictive because developers may want
to store tokens in a unique way that is different what what could be specified.
This proposal removes `ownedNFTs` and only requires a `getIDs()` method
for the collection to indicate which IDs it contains.

### Move `createEmptyCollection()` to inside the Collection definition in addition to the contract

It is useful to be able to create a new empty collection
directly from a `Collection` object instead of having to import
the contract and call the method from the contract.

```cadence
pub resource interface Collection {

    /// createEmptyCollection creates an empty Collection
    /// and returns it to the caller so that they can own NFTs
    pub fun createEmptyCollection(): @{Collection} {
        post {
            result.getIDs().length == 0: "The created collection must be empty!"
        }
    }
}
```

### Add Metadata Views methods to the standard

Metadata Views for non-fungible tokens should be easily accessible
from interfaces defined by the standard. 
This propsal adds the metadata methods to the `NFT` interface and to the
`CollectionPublic` interface.

```cadence
    /// Interface that the NFTs must conform to
    ///
    pub resource interface NFT: MetadataViews.Resolver {
        /// The unique ID that each NFT has
        pub fun getID(): UInt64

        pub fun getViews(): [Type] {
            return []
        }
        pub fun resolveView(_ view: Type): AnyStruct? {
            return nil
        }
    }

    pub resource interface CollectionPublic: MetadataViews.ResolverCollection {
        ...
        pub fun borrowViewResolver(id: UInt64): &{MetadataViews.Resolver}? {
            return nil
        }
        ...
    }
```

In addition to these methods, the proposal also includes methods in the contract
to indicate which NFT types and Collection types the contract defines,
as well as return shared metadata about the project and types.

```cadence
    /// Return the types that the contract defines
    pub fun getNFTTypes(): [Type] {
        post {
            result.length > 0: "Must indicate what non-fungible token types this contract defines"
        }
    }

    /// get a list of all the NFT collection types that the contract defines
    /// could include a post-condition that verifies that each Type is an NFT collection type
    pub fun getCollectionTypes(): [Type]

    /// tells what collection type should be used for the specified NFT type
    /// return `nil` if no collection type exists for the specified NFT type
    pub fun getCollectionTypeForNftType(nftType: Type): Type?

    /// resolve a type to its CollectionData so you know where to store it
    /// Returns `nil` if no collection type exists for the specified NFT type
    pub fun getCollectionData(nftType: Type): MetadataViews.NFTCollectionData?

    /// Returns the CollectionDisplay view for the NFT type that is specified 
    pub fun getCollectionDisplay(nftType: Type): MetadataViews.NFTCollectionDisplay?

```

### Drawbacks

The main drawback of this upgrade is the breaking changes.
It could cause downtime for some projects who aren't prepared to perform the upgrade
right after stable cadence is enabled,
but that applies to any breaking change in stable cadence.
The updates that developers will have to do are fairly straightforward
and will not require much work.

Please share any other drawbacks that you may discover with these changes.

### Alternatives Considered

1. Keep the standard the same:
    * If nested type requirements are removed, this may not be possible
    * This would avoid the breaking changes, which would be nice in the short term, but would not be setting up cadence developers for success in the long term.

### Performance Implications

Most of the methods in the non-fungible token interface are expected to be O(1),
so there is no performance requirements to enforce with the methods.
That is mostly up to the developers who are implementing the tokens to ensure.

The `getIDs()` method can sometimes return a list that is too large for
the transaction or script to handle. We'd like to have some sort of method
that returns a paginated list of IDs instead of the whole list.
Any proposals for that would be appreciated,
but it will likely require a Cadence language update.

Adding metadata parameters to the standard events could cause event payloads
to be quite large if the metadata contained in the events is large.
We don't believe this will be a significant problem though.

### Dependencies

* Adds no new dependencies
* Dependent projects
    * All non-fungible tokens on Flow and some projects that utilize them.

### Engineering Impact

* Build and test time will stay the same. they are relatively small changes.
* The Flow smart contract engineering team will maintain the code
* The code can be tested on its own once a compatible version of cadence is released. 

### Best Practices

* Some of the changes illustrate Cadence best practices, such as encapsulating functionality
within resources, avoiding public fields, and giving developers flexibility to write composable code.

### Tutorials and Examples

* Coming soon once the proposal reaches a more final state

### Compatibility

* FCL, emulator, and other such tools should not be affected besides potentially
having to update standard transactions if they aren't compatible.

### User Impact

* The upgrade will go out at the same time as stable cadence if approved

## Related Issues

### Scoped Providers

A critical piece of tooling for non-fungible tokens would be a struct that contains
a provider capability but restricts the capability to only be able to withdraw
specified IDs or number of tokens from the underlying collection.
Currently, providers have no limit, but all tokens should be able
to create scoped providers.

This feature is out of the scope of this proposal, but should definitely be a standard
that lives alongside the main fungible token standard.
We hope to shepard a proposal for these soon.

### Universal Collection

Each NFT implementor also needs to implement their own Collection resource.
The Collection implementation of the Example NFT contract is 5x as long as the NFT implementation itself. Almost all collection code is copied, so it could be
very nice to have a universal collection that can hold any type of NFT.

This is out of scope of this proposal and can be introduced later.
There are still many more considerations for the universal collection
that need to be discussed.

## Prior Art

In combination with the upgrades to the FT standard, we'd like for users to
be able to utilize more sophisticated functionality in their tokens, such as
what was enabled with an upgrade like ERC-1155 and other such upgrades in Ethereum.
We would greatly appreciate if any developers with ethereum experience could think
about these upgrades from the perspective of being able to create the same kinds 
of projects that are possible with other token standards in other languages.
