# **Technical Working Group - Flow Token Economics**

**Introduction to TWG**

Flow - the next-generation permissionless platform for decentralized applications and digital assets - is launching a Technical Working Group (TWG) to focus on enhancing FLOW token economics. The working group will be responsible for researching, discussing, and driving improvements to the economic design of Flow's native token, FLOW, and its use-cases, with a focus on driving network security, decentralization and FLOW’s value proposition. The group will be open to experts in blockchain, economics, mathematics, game theory, data science, marketing, and related fields, and will work closely with the community to ensure that decisions are data-driven, technically sound, and aligned with the goals of the Flow community.

**Roles & Responsibilities**

Specifically, the group would analyze challenges, design innovative solutions, and constantly engage and educate the community, as summarized below.

- *Analyze*: TWG would analyze Flow blockchain data, conduct user surveys, and gather community feedback to delineate the key problem areas in Flow token economics.
- *Innovate*: The group would be responsible for proposing feasible changes to Flow protocol, governance mechanisms and other related aspects that lead to improved economic design, promote decentralization and contribute to the long-term success of the Flow ecosystem.
- *Engage*: Gathering community feedback, ensuring all proposed changes are aligned with the needs and values of the Flow community, and also educating the community about the problems and solutions would remain a key focus of the TWG.

**Approach**

The constitution and governance of the TWG would be designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability.

- **Tenets**: Overall, the TWG would prioritize inclusivity, transparency, accountability, innovation, and decentralization.
- **Membership** would be voluntary and open to all; anyone with the necessary skills and expertise, including representatives from the Flow Foundation, developers, researchers, community members, and industry experts, would be able to join the group.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: TWG’s responsibilities, key tasks, timelines and deliverables would be clearly defined and communicated to ensure transparency.
- **Decision-making**: The TWG would use a consensus-based decision-making process, with all members sharing equal voting rights, and decisions made democratically.
- **Meetings**: Regular meetings would be held to discuss progress, share ideas, and make decisions. These meetings would be open to all members.
- **Documentation**: All decisions, discussions, and outcomes would be documented to ensure transparency and accountability. Meeting minutes, decision logs, and progress reports would be shared with all members to keep everyone informed.
- **Review and Evaluation**: The TWG would periodically review and evaluate its progress, including gathering community feedback, to ensure that the objectives are being met.

**New Members**

TWG would be open for membership to the entire Flow community. Community members can nominate experts to join the TWG by filling the [nomination form](https://forms.gle/z5jYdqqAtWrQ18447). The nomination should include a brief description of the nominee's qualifications, experience, and skills, along with a statement of support from the nominator. TWG would periodically review nominations and make decisions based on the nominee's qualifications and the group’s needs.
