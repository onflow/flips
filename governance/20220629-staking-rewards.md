## Abstract

This proposal states that the current staking reward of 5% remain unchanged. A future proposal can be used to modify the staking reward rate at any time in the future.

## Background

The [Flow Token Distribution](https://www.onflow.org/token-distribution) details a strategy of using 5% token rewards for the first eighteen months, and then suggests adjusting the rewards rate as decided by the community. This eighteen month window is up on July 30th, 2022 and as such the rewards rate must be re-visited.

## Proposal

Staking Rewards are how the network pays trusted node operators for security. Given the current downturn in the economy it is not desirable to reduce the rewards rate. As such the rewards rate of 5% should remain in effect.
