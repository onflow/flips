## Objective

The objective of this FLIP is to seek community approval for the inclusion of @bluesign as a signer in the multi-signatory process on the Flow blockchain. This addition aims to leverage @bluesign's expertise and experience to enhance the governance and decision-making capabilities of the network.

## Background (What is multi-sig?)

Flow employs a robust process for executing protocol-level changes, requiring the collective agreement of multiple parties to sign and authorize transactions that trigger key event such as modification of protocol-level parameters. This is commonly referred to as the “multi-sig process”.

Notably, the multi-sig process on Flow is associated with two principal accounts that oversee critical aspects of the Flow protocol: the service account, responsible for actions related to protocol parameters, and the staking account, which holds resources linked to staked nodes within the network. These accounts are collectively overseen by multiple signatories - representatives from the Flow ecosystem - who participate in meetings where transactions are simultaneously authorized (or rejected) and submitted only if there’s quorum. 

Visit the [service-account page](https://github.com/onflow/service-account) to view all service account transactions.  

## Motivation

@bluesign is a distinguished member of the Flow community, boasting a track record as a serial founder, game developer, and a strong background in mathematics and engineering. This combination of skills and experience makes @bluesign an ideal candidate to contribute to the governance process on Flow.

The motivation behind this proposal is to benefit from @bluesign's unique insights, industry knowledge, and commitment to the Flow ecosystem. By adding @bluesign as a signer, we aim to bolster the network's decision-making capacity and further align our governance with the best interests of the community.

## User Benefit

The addition of @bluesign as a signer in the multi-signatory process will strengthen governance processes with a diverse set of perspectives, leading to enhanced decision-making capabilities to address critical issues and drive improvements to the Flow network.

## Design Proposal

### Drawbacks

There are minimal drawbacks associated with this proposal; however it's essential to ensure that @bluesign's role as a signer is in line with community expectations and the network's long-term goals, and is transparently communicated - which is one of the goals of this FLIP.

### Alternatives Considered

@bluesign's unique qualifications and contributions to the Flow community make him a compelling choice for this role.

### Performance Implications

This proposal is not expected to have any significant performance implications on the Flow network. It primarily concerns governance and decision-making processes.

### Dependencies

This proposal does not introduce new dependencies to the Flow blockchain. It is a governance-related change and does not affect core functionalities or dependent projects.

### Engineering Impact

There is no direct engineering impact associated with this proposal. The addition of @bluesign as a signer involves administrative and governance considerations.

### Best Practices

This proposal aligns with best practices for enhancing governance by adding experienced and knowledgeable community members to decision-making roles.

### Tutorials and Examples

No tutorials or examples are required for this proposal, as it pertains to governance and signer addition.

### User Impact

The user impact of this proposal is negligible and is primarily related to governance improvements. Users can expect a more robust decision-making process with the addition of @bluesign.

## Questions and Discussion Topics

- Are there any concerns or questions regarding the addition of @bluesign as a signer?
- Do community members support the inclusion of @bluesign as a signer, and if so, are there any specific expectations from his role?

Your feedback and input on this proposal are highly valued, and we look forward to discussions and consensus-building regarding the addition of @bluesign as a multi-sig signer.
